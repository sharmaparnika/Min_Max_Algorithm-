# Min_Max_Algorithm

* Mini-max algorithm is a recursive or backtracking algorithm which is used in decision-making and game theory. It provides an optimal move for the player assuming that opponent is also playing optimally.
* Mini-Max algorithm uses recursion to search through the game-tree.
* Min-Max algorithm is mostly used for game playing in AI. Such as Chess, Checkers, tic-tac-toe, go, and various tow-players game. 
* This Algorithm computes the minimax decision for the current state.
* In this algorithm two players play the game, one is called MAX and other is called MIN.
* Both the players fight it as the opponent player gets the minimum benefit while they get the maximum benefit.
* Both Players of the game are opponent of each other, where MAX will select the maximized value and MIN will select the minimized value.
* The minimax algorithm performs a depth-first search algorithm for the exploration of the complete game tree.
* The minimax algorithm proceeds all the way down to the terminal node of the tree, then backtrack the tree as the recursion.
